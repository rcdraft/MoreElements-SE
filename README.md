# MoreElements Second Edition
This mod is a direct continuation to the unpublished More-Elements. To be specific, this mod originally created for Minecraft 1.16.3 using Fabric.

## Why do you not update that directly?
It is hard to update from **1.14.x** to **1.16.x** - the biggest trouble is Fabric Loom being outdated. Because of this, I have no choice other than create a new repository. I'll implement everything from first before adding new content to this mod.

## IDE Used
This repository has been configured to run under [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and IntelliJ Idea Community. Also, `Typora` is used to edit Markdown files.
