# MoreElements Second Edition
This mod is a direct continuation to the unpublished More-Elements. To be specific, this mod was created for Minecraft 1.16.3 using Fabric.

## Why do you not update that directly?
It is hard to update from **1.14.x** to **1.16.x** - the biggest trouble is Fabric Loom being outdated. Because of this, I have no choise other than create a new repository. I'll implement everything from first before adding new content to this mod.
